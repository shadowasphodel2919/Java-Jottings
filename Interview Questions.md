# Interview Questions
### Can we overload the main method?
Yes, the main method can be overloaded but the execution starts with the main function with (String[] args) arguments.
```
    public class Sample{
        public static void main(){
                    System.out.println("This is the overloaded main method");
                }
                public static void main(String args[]){
                    Sample obj = new Sample();
                    obj.main();
                }
            }
```
