<h1>Multithreading</h1>
This document pertains to the knowledge that I have acquired regarding the implementation of threads in java.
Threads are the singular process(the most smallest unit of process). These are light weight.
During interviews it may be asked what is the difference between process and a thread.

Multithreading means parallel execution of various threads to increase efficiency and for maximum utilization of CPU.

->Implementing the Runnable Interface
->Extending the Thread class

extending will stop more inheritance-extending provides inbuilt function-runnable will give you object which could be used in multiple thread
